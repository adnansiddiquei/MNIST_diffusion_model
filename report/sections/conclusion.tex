\section{Conclusion}\label{sec:conclusion}
In conclusion, this report has detailed the training of a diffusion model on the MNIST dataset using 3 different linear
noise schedules for a DDPM and a custom diffusion model using a fashion MNIST degradation.
All 4 models generated models that were statistically and visually similar in fidelity to each other, but relatively
poor compared to the original MNIST dataset.
It is likely that the CNN architecture used was not complex enough to capture the full complexity of the diffusion processes,
but more investigation will need to be done to confirm this.
